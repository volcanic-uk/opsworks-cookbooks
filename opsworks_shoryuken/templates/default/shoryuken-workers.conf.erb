# /etc/init/shoryuken.conf - manage a set of Shoryukens

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Shoryuken instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See shoryuken.conf for how to manage a single Shoryuken instance.
#
# Use "stop shoryuken-workers-<%= @app_name %>" to stop all Shoryuken instances.
# Use "start shoryuken-workers-<%= @app_name %>" to start all instances.
# Use "restart shoryuken-workers-<%= @app_name %>" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
